lyric,
"Stood there boldly
Sweatin' in the sun",
"Felt like a million
Felt like number one",
"The height of summer
I'd never felt that strong
Like a rock",
"I was eighteen
Didn't have a care",
"Working for peanuts
Not a dime to spare",
"But I was lean and solid everywhere
Like a rock",
"My hands were steady
My eyes were clear and bright",
"My walk had purpose
My steps were quick and light",
"And I held firmly
To what I felt was right
Like a rock",
"Like a rock
I was strong as I could be
Like a rock",
"Nothin' ever got to me
Like a rock",
"I was something to see
Like a rock",
"And I stood arrow straight
Unencumbered by the weight
Of all these hustlers and their schemes",
"I stood proud
I stood tall",
"High above it all
I still believed in my dreams",
"[ ♪♫ instrumental ♫♪ ]",
"Twenty years now
Where'd they go?",
"Twenty years
I don't know",
"I sit and I wonder sometimes
Where they've gone?",
"And sometimes late at night
Oh When I'm bathed in the firelight",
"The moon comes callin' a ghostly white
And I recall
I recall!",
"Like a rock
Standin' arrow straight
Like a rock."
"Chargin' from the gate
Like a rock",
"Carryin the weight
Like a rock",
"Like a rock
The sun upon my skin
Like a rock",
"Hard against the wind
Like a rock",
"I see myself again
Like a rock
Oh Like a rock",
